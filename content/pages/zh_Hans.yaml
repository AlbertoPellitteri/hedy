    -   title: 海迪（Hedy）是什么？
        text: "海迪（Hedy ）是一种文本编程语言，专为（前）青少年（10 至 15 岁）开发。\n与 Scratch 等儿童编程语言相比，海迪（Hedy ）不使用模块，而是使用文本代码。\n因此，借助海迪（Hedy ），您将学习如何像真正的程序员一样输入代码，但要通过有趣的练习分小步进行。\n通过这种方式，Hedy 可以通过一种可交互且非常有趣的方式作为真正的编程语言（如 Python）的基础！\n在这里，您可以观看有关 海迪（Hedy ） 作为编程语言的发展的[视频](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqT313rM40&amp;t=2s)。\n"
    -   title: 目标群体
        text: "海迪（Hedy ）是以中小学生（10-15 岁）为目标开发。\n对学生们来说，能够很好地阅读是很重要的。 我们建议在学生至少达到三年级阅读水平之前不要开始使用 海迪（Hedy ）。\n在开始使用海迪（Hedy ） 之前，学生（和老师！）不需要任何编程经验。\n"
    -   title: 海迪（Hedy ）是如何工作的？
        text: "海迪（Hedy ）分为多个级别，在这些级别中教授新命令。每个级别都包含各种冒险活动来练习新学到的命令。\n作为老师，您可以决定哪些冒险活动适合您的学生。在这个级别他们会开餐厅、设计计算器或鬼屋吗？在每个级别中，冒险活动都是按照从易到难的顺序排列的。\n因此，您的学生将不断接受挑战。冒险活动可以由学生单独完成，或者您可以在课堂教学中指导他们。\n\n冒险活动还包括一个代码范例，以确保数字化知识较少的教师也能够使用海迪（Hedy） ！\n当然，海迪（Hedy ）也迎合了喜欢自己设计课程和冒险活动的有创意的老师！\n\n在编写一定级别的所有冒险活动的程序之后，您的学生可以在测验中测试他们对这些知识的掌握程度。\n您可以在课程页面上追踪学生的作业和学习进度。\n"
    -   title: 设备
        text: "海迪（Hedy）是基于网络的编程语言，这意味着它可以在任何有浏览器的设备上使用（谷歌浏览器、火狐浏览器、Edge等），因此笔记本电脑、铬笔记本、平板电脑甚至智能手机都适合使用海迪（Hedy）。\n在使用海迪（Hedy）之前，不需要下载任何东西，只要进入网站就可以了！\n"
    -   title: 海迪（Hedy ）社区
        text: "欢迎所有海迪（Hedy ）老师、程序员和其他爱好者加入我们的[Discord服务器](https://discord.gg/8yY7dEme9r)。这是聊海迪（Hedy）的理想场所：我们有一些频道，在那里你可以展示你很酷的项目和课程，有一些频道可以报告错误（bug），还有一些频道可以与其他老师和海迪（Hedy）创作团队聊天。\n"

    -   title: 创建一个班级
        text: "作为一名教师，你可以为你的学生创建一个班级。在这个班级里，你可以看到学生的账户和他们编写的程序，你可以监督他们的学习进度。\n你还可以自定义你的班级，选择哪些冒险活动可供你的学生使用。这样，你的学生就不会面对大量的冒险活动和级别而不知所措，他们可以专注于你想要他们练习的冒险活动。\n"
    -   text: "这里有两种方法可以让您的学生们加入您的班级。您可以让他们建立自己的账户，或者您可以为他们创建账户。\n\n**学生建立自己的账户**。\n您的学生们可以到海迪（Hedy）网站上创建自己的账户，就像您做的那样。要让他们进入您的班级，他们只需点击您发给他们的邀请链接就可以了。\n您可以在班级页面上找到这个邀请链接，并将其发送给您的学生们。请注意，您的学生们必须首先登录到海迪（Hedy）然后再点击邀请链接才能顺利加入班级。\n\n**您为您的学生们创建账户**。\n有时，您为自己的学生们创建一大堆账户会比较容易。这可以通过点击 \"创建学生账户 \"按钮，并为他们填写用户名和密码来实现。\n学生们可以用您选择的用户名和密码登录。然后，如果他们愿意，可以改变他们的用户名或密码，他们仍然会留在你的班级中。\n"
    -   text: "当学生创建个人资料时，他们应该选择一种“首选语言”。Hedy将始终以这种选定的语言加载。\n以后可以通过再次导航到“我的帐户”和“我的个人设置”来更改此语言。\n从2021年12月起，每个Hedy帐户都必须设置首选语言。\n当您的帐户或学生的帐户在此日期之前创建时，您将收到一条消息，指出缺少首选语言。\n不用担心！导航到“我的个人资料”，然后在个人资料设置中设置您的首选语言。\n在您设置语言之前，Hedy将以您的浏览器语言显示，当不支持此语言时，将以英语显示。\n\n**对于非英语人士**\n您不仅可以将冒险活动的语言更改为您自己的语言。您还可以选择关键字（例如“打印”或“询问”）应使用的语言。\n通过这种方式，您可以教学生使用英语关键字进行编码，但您也可以让他们用自己的语言进行编程。例如，荷兰学生可以使用“vraag”命令而不是“询问”命令。\n"
    -   text: "由于您现在已登录，因此您将看到带有“我的个人资料”和“我的程序”的蓝色横幅。\n这些选项卡也适用于您的学生。在“我的程序”中，您可以找到已保存的所有程序。\n\n您可以在白色栏中为程序命名并按绿色按钮“保存程序”来轻松保存程序。\n您（和您的学生）也可以共享程序。这些程序将发布在我们的探索页面上，供所有人查看和使用。\n如果要取消共享程序，请转到“我的程序”，然后单击“取消共享”。\n"

    -   title: Introduction
        text: "您可以通过激活学生的已有知识来开始上课：他们对该主题已经知道了什么，他们在上一课中学到了什么，以及他们犯了哪些错误，现在已经从中吸取了哪些教训？\n这样，当您尝试引入新课时，所有以前学到的命令和经常犯的错误都会在学生的记忆中保持新鲜感。\n"
    -   title: 介绍新的概念和命令
        text: "对于一些学生来说，新的概念和命令可能很难完全理解。\n这就是为什么向你的学生示范新命令的正确使用是很重要的。\n特别是在低年级阶段，一些学生根本没有编程经验，他们可能很难理解新的抽象概念。\n展示大量的例子可以使一个抽象的概念（例如：\"什么是变量？\"）更容易被识别和理解（\"看，变量宠物变成了狗\"）。\n"
    -   title: 让我们开始工作
        text: "每个级别都包含不同的冒险活动，你可以在粉红色的标签中找到。第一个粉红色选项卡解释了此级别中的新命令。\n以下选项卡是学生可以尝试并制作自己的冒险活动。\n冒险活动是从易到难排列，因此我们建议您从左侧的冒险活动开始，然后尝试右边的冒险活动。\n最后一个选项卡“下一步是什么”提供了您将在下一个级别中学到的内容的一些提示。当然，您可以给您的学生们选择在每个级别应该进行的冒险活动。\n他们并不总是必须进行每一次冒险活动。每个冒险活动都包含一个范例代码，学生可以使用绿色按钮进行尝试。\n范例代码被复制到工作领域，学生可以在那里尝试代码并对其进行调整以使其成为自己的代码。\n激励您的学生通过添加自己的想法并创作自己的冒险活动，将范例代码转换为自己的代码。\n"
    -   title: 小测验
        text: "要测试您的学生是否已选择该级别中的所有新信息，您可以让他们进行测验。\n该测验包含10个关于新概念和命令的多项选择题。\n并非每个级别都有测验，因为我们仍在编制测验。\n"
    -   text: "通过进行简短的评估来总结您的课。学生们学到了什么？他们遇到了哪些困难？\n他们是如何从错误中学习的？当然：他们创造了什么？\n学生往往对自己的作品感到非常自豪，所以最好给学生一点时间让他们有机会向同学展示他们的工作。\n"

        text: "Hedy contains a lot of different levels that each teach a different new skill. We recommend to teach one level per lesson.\nThis gives your students the time to fully grasp a new command or concept and practice with it, before moving on to the next level.\nWe use this structure in our lessons: Introduction, New concepts and commands, let's get to work, puzzels and quizzes.\n"

        text: "You can start your lessons by activating your students' prior knowledge: What do they already know about the subject, what did they learn in the previous lesson and which mistakes did they make that they've now learned from?\nThis way all the previously learned commands and frequently made mistakes are fresh in your students' memories, when you strat introducing the new lesson.\n"
    -   title: Introduction of new concepts and commands
        text: "The new concepts and commands can be very hard for some students to fully understand.\nThat's why it's of importance to model the proper use of the new commands to your students.\nEspecially in the lower levels, where some students have no experience whith programming at all, it can be hard for them to understand the new abstract concepts.\nShowing a lot of examples makes an abstract concept (for instance: 'What is a variable?') more recognizable and easier to understand ('Look, the variable pet changed into dog').\n"

        text: "Each level contains different adventures that you can find in the pink tabs. The first pink tab explains the new commands in this level.\nThe following tabs are adventures that the students can try out and make their own.\nThe adventures are arranged from easiest to hardest, so we recommend to start on the left and your your way to the right.\nThe last tab 'what's next' gives a little teaser of what you'll learn in the next level. Of course, you can select the adventures you want your students to do for each level.\nThey don't always have to make every adventure. Every adventure contains an example code, that the students can try out with the green button.\nThe example code gets copied to the workfield, where the students can try out the code and adjust it to make it their own.\nStimulate your students to turn the example codes into their own projects by adding their own ideas and making their own variation of the adventure.\n"

        sections:
        -   title: Students forget to type commandos
            example:
                error_text: "For example they type a sentence without using print.\n"
                error_code: "Hedy can't print this\n"

                solution_code: "print Hedy can print this!\n"
        -   title: Students use capitals when typing commands
            example:
                error_text: "Commands won't work if they are in capitals.\n"
                error_code: "Ask Why does my code fail?\nPrint Because I'm using capitals.\n"

        -   example:
                error_code: "echo Your name is\n"
                error_text: "Echo is made to repeat an answer after an ask command. Without ask echo won't do anything.\n"
                solution_text: "Add an ask command to make it work.\n"
                solution_code: "ask What's your name?\necho Your name is\n"
            title: Students use echo without ask
        -   title: Students want their echo word (variable) to be in the middle of a sentence
            example:
                error_text: "And they are right! That's why they will learn to use proper variables in the next level.\n"
                error_code: "ask Which programming language is the most fun?\necho is the best!\n"

        -   title: 'Turtle: Students let the turtle walk off of the screen'
            example:
                error_text: "Often students love to try out big numbers when using the turtle, which causes the arrow to walk off the screen.\n"
                error_code: "forward 300\nturn 90\n"
                solution_text: "In the example. students tend to think that the turn command doesn't work. Eventhough is does work, but you can't see it happening off screen. Use smaller numbers to prevent this from happening.\n"
                solution_code: "forward 100\nturn 90\n"
        -   title: "Turtle: Students use the command backward, but that doesn't exist"
            example:
                error_text: "Backward is not a command.\n"
                error_code: "backward 100\n"
                solution_text: "To make the turtle go backwards, you use the forward command and a negative number. For example:\n"

                error_code: "prinnt Don't make typos!\n"
                solution_text: "Teach your students to read the error messages. This way they can find out themselves what went wrong.\n"
                solution_code: "print Don't make typos!\n"
        -   example:
                solution_code: "order is ask What would you like to eat?\n"
                error_text: "In this level students learn about variables. The ask command requires a variable as well, but students forget this.\n"
                error_code: "ask what would you like to eat?\n"
                solution_text: "In this level you have to tell Hedy where to save your answer, so it can be used later on. This is called a variable.\n"
            title: Students forget that the ask command has changed
        -   title: 'Students try to use the echo command '
            example:
                error_text: "For some students it might be frustrating to learn that the echo command doesn't work anymore. That's why it's very important to explain the advantages of using variables. For example you can use multiple variables in a code, and you can put them anywhere you like in a sentence!\n"
                error_code: "answer is ask Why doesn't echo work anymore?!\necho\n"
                solution_text: "Use a varible instead.\n"
                solution_code: "answer is ask Why doens't echo work anymore?!\nprint answer\n"
        -   title: Students use a variable name or as a normal word
            example:
                error_text: "In the example below the word 'name' is used a a variable, but also as a normal text. The output of this code will be 'Hi my Hedy is Hedy'.\n"
                error_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi my name is name\n"
                solution_text: "So don't use a word you want to use in the text as a variable name. In level 4 this is solved with quotation marks.\n"
                solution_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi I'm name\n"
        -   title: Students use long variable names containing two words.
            example:
                error_text: "A variable should be named with one word. You could use an underscore to connect two words. That counts as one.\n"
                error_code: "chosen door is ask Which door do you pick?\n"
                solution_text: "Add an underscore.\n"
                solution_code: "chosen_door is ask which door do you pick?\n"
        -   title: Students might use two different names for the same variable
            example:
                error_text: "In this example the student has used 'horse' and 'name' for the same variables.\n"
                error_code: "horse is ask What is your horse called?\nprint Your horse is called name\n"
                solution_text: "Always check wheter the variable has the same name throughout the code. Slight differences can be hard to spot (for example plurals) but they will interfere with the code.\n"
                solution_code: "name is ask What is your horse called?\nprint Your horse is called name\n"
        level: '2'
    -   level: '3'
        sections:
        -   title: Students try to print whole lists
            example:
                error_text: "A list can't be printed. You can only print one item from the list with at random.\n"
                error_code: "groceries is apples, milk, chocolate\nprint groceries\n"
                solution_text: "To print a list of all the groceries, you simply need to put them after a print command. Else you can use the list to print one item with at random.\n"
                solution_code: "print apples, milk, chocolate\n\nor\n\ngroceries is apples, milk, chocolate\nprint groceries at random\n"
        -   title: Students use the name of a variable or list as regular text
            example:
                error_text: "This problem probably occured in level 2 as well. Now it can happen with lists too.\n"
                error_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi my name is name\n\nor\n\nanimal is rhino, bee, swan\nprint The best animal is... animal at random\n"
                solution_text: "Don't use the names of variables or lists in regular text to print. In level 4 this problem is solves with quotation marks.\n"
                solution_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi I'm name\n\nor\n\nanimals is rhino, bee, swan\nprint The best animal is... animals at random\n"
        -   title: Students forget at in at random
            example:
                error_text: "Like in the example\n"
                error_code: "birds is sparrow, seagull, robin\nprint birds random\n"
                solution_text: "This problem is solved by adding the word at.\n"
                solution_code: "birds is sparrow, seagull, robin\nprint birds at random\n"
        -   title: Students forget to use the print command when also using the at random command
            example:
                error_text: "Or they will sometimes put at random at the beginning of the line.\n"
                error_code: "fruit is apple, cherry, banana\nfruit at random\n"
                solution_text: "Emphasize to your students that you always need a print to print text.\n"
                solution_code: "fruit is apple, cherry, banana\nprint fruit at random\n"
        -   title: Students forget to use commas in their lists
            example:
                error_text: "In a list items are seperated with a comma.\n"
                error_code: "pizzas is funghi tonno quattro stagioni\nprint pizzas at random\n"
                solution_text: "After each item on your list, there should be a comma\n"
                solution_code: "pizzas is funghi, tonno, quattro stagioni\nprint pizzas at random\n"
        -   title: Students try to use at random without a list
            example:
                error_text: "For example\n"
                error_code: "clubs is Manchester United\nprint clubs at random\n"
                solution_text: "Hedy can't print anything at random, because there is no list to choose from.\n"
                solution_code: "clubs is Manchester United, Bayrn Munchen, FC Barcelona\nprint clubs at random\n"

                error_code: "names is Jake\nyour_name is ask Who are you?\nadd your_name to names\nprint names at random\n"
                solution_text: "There has to be a list first, so you have to add a second name to turn names into a list, for example Amy. If you don't want amy on your list, you can use remove to remove it after.\n"
                solution_code: "names is Jake, Amy\nyour_name is ask Who are you?\nadd your_name to names\nprint names at random\n"
        -   title: Students forget to use to/from in add/remove
            example:
                error_text: "Without to/from the add/remove command won't work.\n"
                error_code: "adventures is story, parrot, dice\nchoice is Which adventure do you like best?\nadd choice\nremove dice\nprint I love adventures at random\n"

    intro: "You can learn from your mistakes, especially in coding!\nMaking mistakes is unavoidable, and a great opportunity to learn, but for teachers it can be a challenge to find the correct fix for a mistake!\nEspecially as the codes get longer and longer as the levels progress. That's why we've made a list with frequently made mistakes in each level, and their solutions.\n"

    text: |
        学习编程是一件很难的事情。不是说编程本身很难! 而是你需要记住很多规则，就像你刚刚开始学习英语时一样。
        同样的，你也需要通过做大量练习题来学习编程。

        当然你现在可以轻松地读懂这段话。但你还记得你小时候是怎么学习阅读的吗？你那时候学习每个字都需要花费一定的时间!
        对于编程来说也是如此，刚刚开始学的时候可能会觉得很难，但以后会变得越来越容易!

        Hedy（海迪）最大的好处就是你可以*循序渐进*的学习编程。这意味着你不必一下子学会所有的规则
        最初的几个级别里面没有太多的规则，所以你一开始就可以轻松的学习编程。
        在每一个级别里面我们都会增加新的规则，增加你所知道的命令数量。命令是计算机的指令。

        Teachers can use our free, built-in lesson plans, but can also author their own lessons and load these into the Hedy user interface.
-   title: "我需要有编程经验吗？"
    text: |
        不，这不需要。不过，如果你曾经用Scratch或Python编写过程序，你会觉得有些命令很熟悉
-   title: "Hedy（海迪）是免费的吗？"
    text: |
        是的！莱顿大学允许我们免费分享它。Hedy（海迪） 也是 "开源 "的，这意味着每个会编程的人都可以帮助我们把 Hedy（海迪） 做得更好。
