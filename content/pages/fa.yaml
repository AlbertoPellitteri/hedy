        text: "هدی یک زبان برنامه نویسی متنی است که به طور خاص برای (قبل از) نوجوانان (10 تا 15 سال) توسعه یافته است.\nبرخلاف زبان‌های برنامه‌نویسی برای کودکان، مانند Scratch، هدی از بلوک‌های کد استفاده نمی‌کند، بلکه از کد متنی استفاده می‌کند.\nبنابراین با  هدی یاد خواهید گرفت که چگونه مانند برنامه نویسان واقعی کد را تایپ کنید، اما در مراحل کوچک با تمرینات بازی گونه.\nبه این ترتیب هدی می تواند به عنوان پله ای برای زبان های برنامه نویسی واقعی مانند پایتون و به روشی در دسترس و بیشتر سرگرم کننده عمل کند!\nدر اینجا می توانید یک [ویدئو](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqT313rM40&amp;t=2s) درباره توسعه هدی به عنوان یک زبان برنامه نویسی تماشا کنید.\n"
    -   title: مخاطبان مورد هدف
        text: "هدی با در نظر گرفتن دانش‌آموزان دبیرستانی و دبستانی (سنین 10 تا 15) توسعه یافته است.\nمهم است که دانش اموزان بتوانند خوب بخوانند. توصیه می‌کنیم قبل از اینکه دانش‌آموزان حداقل به سطح خواندن کلاس سوم دست یابند، با هدی شروع نکنید.\nدانش آموزان (و معلمان!) قبل از شروع با هدی به هیچ تجربه برنامه نویسی نیاز ندارند.\n"

        text: "Hedy is divided into levels, in which new commands are taught.Each level contains a variety of exercises to practice to newly learned commands.\nThe exercises can be done by the students individually, or you can use them in classical instructions. The lesson plans for each level are included in this teacher manual.\nThe lesson plans and exercises are explained step by step, to make sure the less digitally informed teachers should be able to use Hedy too!\nOf course Hedy also caters to the creative teachers that love to make their own lessonplans and exercises!\n"
    -   title: Devices
        text: "Hedy is webbased, which means it works on any device with a browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge etc), so laptops, chromebooks, tablets and even smartphones are suitable to use Hedy.\nThere's no need to download anything before working with Hedy, just go to the website and you're all set!\n"

    -   title: Teaching with Hedy
        text: "Hedy contains a lot of different levels that each teach a different new skill. We recommend to teach one level per lesson.\nThis gives your students the time to fully grasp a new command or concept and practice with it, before moving on to the next level.\nWe use this structure in our lessons:\n"
    -   title: Introduction
        text: "You can start your lessons by activating your students' prior knowledge: What do they already know about the subject, what did they learn in the previous lesson and which mistakes did they make that they've now learned from?\nThis way all the previously learned commands and frequently made mistakes are fresh in your students' memories, when you strat introducing the new lesson.\n"
    -   title: Introduction of new concepts and commands
        text: "The new concepts and commands can be very hard for some students to fully understand.\nThat's why it's of importance to model the proper use of the new commands to your students.\nEspecially in the lower levels, where some students have no experience whith programming at all, it can be hard for them to understand the new abstract concepts.\nShowing a lot of examples makes an abstract concept (for instance: 'What is a variable?') more recognizable and easier to understand ('Look, the variable pet changed into dog').\n"
    -   title: Let's get to work
        text: "Each level contains different adventures that you can find in the pink tabs. The first pink tab explains the new commands in this level.\nThe following tabs are adventures that the students can try out and make their own.\nThe adventures are arranged from easiest to hardest, so we recommend to start on the left and your your way to the right.\nThe last tab 'what's next' gives a little teaser of what you'll learn in the next level. Of course, you can select the adventures you want your students to do for each level.\nThey don't always have to make every adventure. Every adventure contains an example code, that the students can try out with the green button.\nThe example code gets copied to the workfield, where the students can try out the code and adjust it to make it their own.\nStimulate your students to turn the example codes into their own projects by adding their own ideas and making their own variation of the adventure.\n"
    -   title: Quiz
        text: "To test whether your students have picked up all the new info in the level, you can let them make the quiz.\nThe quiz contains 10 multiple choice questions about the new concepts and command to that level.\nNot every level has a quiz yet, as we are still building the quizzes.\n"
    -   text: "Round up your lesson by having a brief evaluation. What did the students learn? Which hardships did they come across?\nHow did they learn from their mistakes? And of course: What did they create?\nStudents are often very proud of their own creations, so it's nice to save a little time and gove your students the opportunity to show their work to their classmates.\n"

                error_text: "Commands won't work if they are in capitals.\n"
                solution_text: "Remove the capitals.\n"
        -   example:
                error_code: "echo Your name is\n"
                solution_text: "Add an ask command to make it work.\n"
            title: Students use echo without ask
        -   example:
                error_text: "And they are right! That's why they will learn to use proper variables in the next level.\n"

                error_text: "Hedy can't recognize a command with a typo.\n"
                solution_text: "Teach your students to read the error messages. This way they can find out themselves what went wrong.\n"
        -   title: Students forget that the ask command has changed
            example:
                error_code: "ask what would you like to eat?\n"
                solution_code: "order is What would you like to eat?\n"
        -   example:
                error_text: "For some students it might be frustrating to learn that the echo command doesn't work anymore. That's why it's very important to explain the advantages of using variables. For example you can use multiple variables in a code, and you can put them anywhere you like in a sentence!\n"
                solution_text: "Use a varible instead.\n"
        -   title: Students use a variable name or as a normal word
            example:
                error_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi my name is name\n"
                solution_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi I'm name\n"

                error_text: "A variable should be named with one word. You could use an underscore to connect two words. That counts as one.\n"
                solution_text: "Add an underscore.\n"
        -   title: Students might use two different names for the same variable
            example:

                solution_code: "print apples, milk, chocolate\n\nor\n\ngroceries is apples, milk, chocolate\nprint groceries at random\n"
        -   example:
                error_text: "This problem probably occured in level 2 as well. Now it can happen with lists too.\n"
                solution_text: "Don;t use the names of variables or lists in regular text to print. In level 4 this problem is solves with quotation marks.\n"
        -   title: Students forget at in at random
            example:
                error_code: "birds is sparrow, seagull, robin\nprint birds random\n"
                solution_code: "birds is sparrow, seagull, robin\nprint birds at random\n"

                error_text: "Or they will sometimes put at random at the beginning of the line.\n"
                solution_text: "Emphasize to your students that you always need a print to print text.\n"
        -   title: Students forget to use commas in their lists
            example:
                error_code: "pizzas is funghi tonno quattro stagioni\nprint pizzas at random\n"
                solution_code: "pizzas is funghi, tonno, quattro stagioni\nprint pizzas at random\n"

        sections:
        -   example:
                error_text: "In this level print and ask need a set of quotation marks. One before of the text and one after.\n"
                solution_text: "Add the correct quotation marks.\n"
        -   title: Students use the wrong quotation marks
            example:
                error_code: "print `Welcome to the restaurant`\nfood is ask \"What would you like to order?\"\n"

                solution_text: "Always use 2 quotes in a print command.\n"
        -   title: Students use quotes around variable names.
            example:
                error_code: "if 'name' is 'Hedy' print 'fun'\nelse print 'meh!'\n"
                solution_code: "if name is Hedy print 'fun'\nelse print 'meh!\n"

                solution_text: "In this code the output screen will print '10'.\n"
        -   title: Students struggle with the concept of doing maths with a variable
            example:
                error_code: "age = ask 'How old are you?'\nprint 'Next year you will be ' age + 1\n"

-   title: "Textual programming made easy!"
    text: |
        Many schools and teachers around the world want to teach their students programming. Initially this is often done with playful tools, ranging from the Beebot robot to
        Scratch Junior or Scratch. After using such tools, kids often want to move to more powerful, textual programming languages, like Python.

        Python however is hard, because it is only available in English, and requires learners to learn complex programming concepts and syntax at once.
        Hedy is the easy way to get started with textual programming languages! Hedy is free to use, open source, and unlike any other textual programming language in three ways.

        1. Hedy is multi-lingual, you can use Hedy in your own language
        2. Hedy is gradual, so you can learn one concept and its syntax a time
        3. Hedy is built for the classroom, allowing teachers to fully customize their student's experience
-   title: "Multi-lingual programming"
    text: |
        While almost all textual programming language have keywords in English, such as `for` or `repeat`, Hedy can be used in any language! We currently support 39 different languages, including Spanish, Arabic, Simplified Chinese and Hindi. If your language is not available you can always start a a new translation.
-   title: "Step by step learning"
    text: |
        Learning a programming language can be overwhelming, since learners have to learn concepts (for example if-else or loops) and syntax (like quotation marks or round brackets) at the same time. In Hedy, concepts are first introduced with little syntax and then refined. A scientifically proven way to learn!
-   title: "Built for the classroom"
    text: |
        Hedy is suitable for kids aged 10 and up and designed for classroom use.
        Teachers can use our free, built-in lesson plans, but can also author their own lessons and load these into the Hedy user interface.
-   title: "Programming in context"
    text: |
        Hedy shows programming in the broadest way possible, and can be used in variety of exciting ways. Hedy allows for the creation of digital and interactive stories, colorful drawings that can be shown on the screen but also drawn with a pen plotter or embroidered on a shirt, and can be used to create games or apps with buttons and keyboard actions.
-   title: "Is Hedy free?"
    text: |
        Yes! Hedy is 'Open source', which means that everyone can help us make Hedy better.
        You can find our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy).
        If you like Hedy and want to contribute, we accept (and are very grateful for) [donations](https://github.com/sponsors/hedyorg)!

-   title: "Do I need to install anything?"
    text: |-
        No. Hedy works in the browser, which is the program you are using to look at this page. Probably Chrome or Edge or Firefox. Hedy also works on phones and tablets.
-   title: "Do I need programming experience to teach with Hedy?"
    text: |-
        No, that is not needed. All concepts are explained in the slides and in the interface for learners.
        If you create a free teacher's account, you also get access to the teacher's manual with information on how to teach
        and frequently made mistakes.
