                story_text: "## 'Quotation marks'\nIn level 4 `{ask}` and `{print}` have changed.\nYou must put text that you want to print between quotation marks.\nThis is useful, because now you can print all the words you want. Also the words you used to store something with `{is}`.\nMost programming languages also use quotation marks when printing, so we are also getting a step closer to real programming!\n"
                story_text_2: "## Contractions\nImportant! Mind that now that we're using quotation marks, Hedy will get confused when you use the apostrophe for contractions like I'm or What's.\nMake sure to remove those apostrophes and change the spelling to I am or What is.\nCheck out the example code to see the wrong way of using apostrophes.\n"
                example_code: "```\n{print} 'You need to use quotation marks from now on!'\nanswer {is} {ask} 'What do we need to use from now on?'\n{print} 'We need to use ' answer\n```\n"
                example_code_2: "```\n_ This is the wrong way of using apostrophes _\n{print} 'I'm babysitting my sister's kids'\n{print} 'What's more fun than that?'\n```\n"

                story_text: "## If... else....\nIn level 5 there is something new, the `{if}`! With the `{if}` you can choose between two different options.\nThis code prints nice if you enter Hedy as a name, and boo! if you enter something else.\n`{ask}` and `{print}` still work like they did in level 4.\n"
                example_code: "```\nname {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'\n{if} name {is} Hedy {print} 'nice' {else} {print} 'boo!'\n```\n"
                story_text_3: "## Lists\nWhen we want to check if something is in a list, we can now use the `{in}` command.\nThis code prints pretty! if you choose green or yellow, and meh otherwise.\n"
                example_code_3: "```\npretty_colors {is} green, yellow\nfavorite_color {is} {ask} 'What is your favorite color?'\n{if} favorite_color {in} pretty_colors {print} 'pretty!'\n{else} {print} 'meh'\n```\n"
                story_text_2: "Sometimes code with an `{if}` gets really long and does not fit on the line well. <br> You may also divide the code over two lines, starting the second line at the `{else}` like this:\n"
                example_code_2: "```\nname {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'\n{if} name {is} Hedy {print} 'nice'\n{else} {print} 'boo!'\n```\n"
                story_text_4: "Something else that works with `{if}` is `{pressed}`! With `{pressed}` you can link any letter in the alphabet and any number key on your keyboard to a command. If you link it, and press the key, something will happen. Try it out!\n"
                example_code_4: "```\n{if} x {is} {pressed} {print} 'it worked!'\n```\n"
            18:
                story_text_2: If you want to print more than one item, you need to separate them by commas.

                story_text: "## The last level!\nWe arrived at real Python code! That means we need to use parentheses with {print} and {range} from now on.\nIt also means you can use Hedy code from this level in any Python environment as long as you use the English commands. If you haven't until now, you can switch the toggle in the commands menu to do so."
                example_code: "```\n{print}('Hello!')\n{for} i {in} {range}(1, 10):\n    {print}('This is line ', i)\n```\n"

                story_text_3: "## Input\nThe final change we will need to make to get Python code is changing `{ask}` into `{input}`."

Or press the green button in the example code block, and the code will be typed for you!\nTry the code yourself with the green 'Run code' button under the programming field.\n\nYou can print text to the screen using the `{print}` command.     \n"
                example_code: "```\n{print} Hello!\n{print} Welcome to Hedy!\n```\n"
                story_text_2: "You can also ask for input with `{ask}` and repeat it back with an `{echo}` command.\n"

            2:
                story_text: "## Variables\nIn level 2 we learn two new commands: `{is}` and `{sleep}`.\nYou can name a word with `{is}`. This is called a variable. In this example we made a variable called name and a variable called age. You can use the word name anywhere in your code and it will be replaced by Hedy, like this:\n\nThis way you no longer need the `{echo}` command!\n"
                example_code: "```\nname {is} Hedy\nage {is} 15\n{print} name is age years old\n```\n"
                story_text_2: "`{print}` still works the same, but the `{ask}` command has changed. You need to use a variable in the `{ask}` command as well. It looks like this:\n"
                example_code_2: "```\nanswer {is} {ask} What is your name?\n{print} Hello answer\n```\n"
                story_text_3: "Another new command in this level is `{sleep}`, which pauses your program for a second. If you type a number behind the {sleep} command, the program pauses for that amount of seconds.\n"
                example_code_3: "```\n{print} My favorite colour is...\n{sleep} 2\n{print} green!\n```\n"

            3:
                story_text: "## Make a list!\nIn level 3 you can make a list. You can let the computer choose something random from the list. You do that with `{at} {random}`.\n"
                example_code: "```\nanimals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo\n{print} animals {at} {random}\n```\n"
                story_text_2: You can also add items to the list with `{add}` and remove items with `{remove}`.
                example_code_2: "```\nanimals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo\n{add} penguin {to_list} animals\n{remove} cat {from} animals\n{print} animals {at} {random}\n```\n"

                story_text: "## 1 + 1\n In this level you learn something new: you can now also calculate.\n\n The plus is easy, you write it like with math: `5 + 5` for example. The minus also works fine, it is `5 - 5`.\n\n The times is a bit different, because there is no times symbol on your keyboard. Just search, there really isn't!\n That is why we multiply with the asterisk above 8: `5 * 5`. Read that as \"5 times 5\" that helps you remember it best.\n"
                example_code: "```\n{print} '5 plus 5 is ' 5 + 5\n{print} '5 minus 5 is ' 5 - 5\n{print} '5 times 5 is ' 5 * 5\n```\n"
                story_text_2: "We also make a change in storing a word in a variable! You may now use `=` instead of  `{is}` when we store a name or a number in a variable, like this:\n"
                example_code_2: "```\nname = Hedy\nanswer = 20 + 4\n```\n"

But `{if}`, `{else}`, {pressed} and `{repeat}` have changed!\nYou can now group several lines together, but you will have to *indent* the code.\nThat means putting four spaces at the beginning of the line. You will also have to indent when you just want to create a block of one line.\n"
                example_code: "This is how the `{repeat}` command works now:\n```\n{repeat} 5 {times}\n    {print} 'Hello everyone'\n    {print} 'This is all repeated 5 times'\n```\nThis is how the `{if}` and `{else}` command work now:\n\n```\nname {is} {ask} 'What is your name?'\n{if} name {is} Hedy\n    {print} 'Welcome Hedy'\n    {print} 'You can play on your computer!'\n{else}\n    {print} 'INTRUDER!'\n    {print} 'You cannot use this computer!'\n```\n"

                story_text: "## All together now!\nIn this level you can not only use multiple lines with `{if}` and `{repeat}`, but you can also put them together!\nIn the example you see an `{if}` command within a `{repeat}` command. It is also allowed the other way around, and an `{if}` is also allowed in an `{if}` and a `{repeat}` in a `{repeat}`.\nGive it a try!\n"
                example_code: "```\n{repeat} 3 {times}\n    food = {ask} 'What do you want?'\n    {if} food {is} pizza\n        {print} 'nice!'\n    {else}\n        {print} 'pizza is better'\n```\n"

In earlier levels, we used `{for}` with a list, but we can also use `{for}` with numbers.\nWe do that by adding a variable name, followed by  `{in}` `{range}`. We then write the number to start at, `{to}` and the number to end at.\n\nTry the example to see what happens! In this level again, you will need to use indentations in lines below the `{for}` statements."

                story_text: "## Numbers and texts\n**Decimal numbers**\nSo far, Hedy did not allow for decimal numbers like 1.5, but now we do allow that. Note that computers use the `.` for decimal numbers."

                story_text_3: "**All items in lists need quotation marks too**\nLists are texts, so they need quotation marks too. Mind that each single item on the list has quotation marks.\nThis allows you to save two words as 1 item on the list, for example 'Iron Man'.\n"
